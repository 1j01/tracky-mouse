This moves the cursor according to visible movement of 2D points on your face within the camera's view, so it responds to both head rotation and translation.\n- At 100% it will use only head tilt. This uses an estimate of your face's orientation in 3D space, and ignores head translation. Note that this is smoothed, so it's not as responsive as point tracking. In this mode you never need to recenter by pushing the cursor to the edge of the screen.\n- In between it will behave like an automatic calibration, subtly adjusting the point tracking to match the head tilt. This works by slowing down mouse movement that is moving away from the position that would be expected based on the head tilt, and (only past 80% on the slider) actively moving towards it.": "Blends between using point tracking (2D) and detected head tilt (3D).\n- At 0% it will use only point tracking.
